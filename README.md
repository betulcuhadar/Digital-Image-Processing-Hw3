# Digital Image Processing Homework 3

#### Circle Detection and Plant Segmentation

This project begins by segmenting the image into different regions using k-means clustering, and then creates a binary mask to isolate a specific plant segment. Afterward, it computes the distance transform of the plant mask and detects circles within the plant region using Hough Circle Transform. The project allows users to experiment with different circle detection parameters and visualize the results. Additionally, it demonstrates median filtering for noise reduction in the Lab color space, thresholding techniques, and parameter optimization for circle detection.
